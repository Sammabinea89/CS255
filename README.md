Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was our main project all semester. DriverPass was created to address the issue of insufficient driving instruction. They discovered that nearly 65% of people who took the test at the DMV failed. By using both online and offline tools, this project aimed to improve driver education.

What did you do particularly well?

This class has really improved my ability to look at systems and make pictures that show vague ideas. Thank you for the class, exercise, order, and data flow models that helped me understand better. I'm pleased with them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

My goal is to make a UML class model that works better. There is definitely more that can be done to make the methods I listed better. While it was easy to record the system's accessor methods, the classes' dependencies mean that they need to be looked at in more detail and how they will be used to help the system's end users. It would be helpful to have more ways to deal with these problems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When I designed systems, I always thought about what the end customer would need. I made drawings that showed how most people would use the system. When I made my guesses about the class diagram, I looked at how the order and activity diagrams were used. If you don't think about what people want and need when you create a system, it might become too academic to solve the problems it was made to solve.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Taking this class really helped me understand how important adaptive design is. With this plan, I don't have to slow down as much to get more details than I did before. I like to look over a project more than once because each time gives me more information and understanding. In later works, I want to build on this approach even more.
